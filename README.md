### Project 0

#### 0. Creating an interface for a student
**Mandatory**

Copy the following configuration files (provided above) into the `task_0` directory: `package.json`, `.eslintrc.js`, `tsconfig.json`, `webpack.config.js`

Write your code in the `js/main.ts` file:

Write an interface named `Student` that accepts the following elements:
- `firstName: string`
- `lastName: string`
- `age: number`
- `location: string`

Create 2 students variables called `student1` and `student2` and store them into an array named `studentsList`.

Using Vanilla Javascript, render a table and for each element in the array, append a new row to the table. Each row should contain the first name of the student and the location.

**Requirements:**
- When running, Webpack should return `No type errors found.`
- Every variable should use TypeScript when possible.

### Project 1

#### 1. Let's build a Teacher interface
**Mandatory**

Create a directory `task_1` and copy these configuration files into this folder: `package.json`, `tsconfig.json`, `webpack.config.js`.

Write your code in the `js/main.ts` file:

Write an interface named `Teacher` that accepts the following elements:
- `firstName: string` - can only be set during initialization of an object of this interface
- `lastName: string` - can only be set during initialization of an object of this interface
- `fullTimeEmployee: boolean`

Add the possibility to add any attribute to the `Teacher` object like `contract(boolean)` without specifying the name of the attribute:
- Property should be a string
- Type of this property can be anything

**Requirements:**
- When running, Webpack should return `No type errors found.`
- Every variable should use TypeScript when possible.
### Project 2

#### 5. Advanced types Part 1
**Mandatory**

Create the `DirectorInterface` interface with the 3 expected methods:
- `workFromHome()` returning a string
- `getCoffeeBreak()` returning a string
- `workDirectorTasks()` returning a string

Create the `TeacherInterface` interface with the 3 expected methods:
- `workFromHome()` returning a string
- `getCoffeeBreak()` returning a string
- `workTeacherTasks()` returning a string

Create a class `Director` that will implement `DirectorInterface`:
- `workFromHome` should return the string `Working from home`
- `getCoffeeBreak` should return the string `Getting a coffee break`
- `workDirectorTasks` should return the string `Getting to director tasks`

Create a class `Teacher` that will implement `TeacherInterface`:
- `workFromHome` should return the string `Cannot work from home`
- `getCoffeeBreak` should return the string `Cannot have a break`
- `workTeacherTasks` should return the string `Getting to work`

Create a function `createEmployee` with the following requirements:
- It can return either a `Director` or a `Teacher` instance
- It accepts 1 argument:
  - `salary` (either number or string)
  - if `salary` is a number and less than 500 - It should return a new `Teacher`. Otherwise, it should return a `Director`

**Requirements:**
- When running, Webpack should return `No type errors found.`
- Every variable should use TypeScript when possible.
### Project 6

#### 6. Creating functions specific to employees
**Mandatory**

Write a function `isDirector`:

- It accepts `employee` as an argument.
- It will be used as a type predicate to check if the employee is a `Director`.

Write a function `executeWork`:

- It accepts `employee` as an argument.
- If the employee is a `Director`, it will call `workDirectorTasks`.
- If the employee is a `Teacher`, it will call `workTeacherTasks`.

**Requirements:**
- When running, Webpack should return `No type errors found.`
- Every variable should use TypeScript when possible.
### Project 7

#### 7. String literal types
**Mandatory**

Write a String literal type named `Subjects` allowing a variable to have the value `Math` or `History` only. Write a function named `teachClass`:

- It takes `todayClass` as an argument.
- It will return the string `Teaching Math` if `todayClass` is `Math`.
- It will return the string `Teaching History` if `todayClass` is `History`.

**Requirements:**
- When running, Webpack should return `No type errors found.`
- Every variable should use TypeScript when possible.

### Project 8

#### 8. Ambient Namespaces
**Mandatory**

Create a directory called `task_3` and copy these configuration files into it: `package.json`, `webpack.config.js`, `tsconfig.json`.

The first part will require that you build an interface and a type. Inside a file named `interface.ts`:

- Create a type `RowID` and set it equal to `number`.
- Create an interface `RowElement` that contains these 3 fields:
  - `firstName: string`
  - `lastName: string`
  - `age?: number`

You are building the next part of the application architecture. The goal is to save the entities to a database. Because of time constraints, you canâ€™t write a connector to the database, and you decided to download a library called `crud.js`. Copy this file into the `task_3/js` directory.

```javascript
export function insertRow(row) {
  console.log('Insert row', row);
  return Math.floor(Math.random() * Math.floor(1000));
}

export function deleteRow(rowId) {
  console.log('Delete row id', rowId);
  return;
}

export function updateRow(rowId, row) {
  console.log(`Update row ${rowId}`, row);
  return rowId;
}
```

Write an ambient file within `task_3/js`, named `crud.d.ts` containing the type declarations for each crud function. At the top of the file import `RowID` and `RowElement` from `interface.ts`.

In `main.ts`:

- At the top of the file create a triple slash directive that includes all the dependencies from `crud.d.ts`.
- Import the `RowID` type and `RowElement` from `interface.ts`.
- Import everything from `crud.js` as `CRUD`.

Create an object called `row` with the type `RowElement` with the fields set to these values:
- `firstName: Guillaume`
- `lastName: Salva`

Create a `const` variable named `newRowID` with the type `RowID` and assign the value the `insertRow` command.

Next, create a `const` variable named `updatedRow` with the type `RowElement` and update `row` with an `age` field set to `23`.

Finally, call the `updateRow` and `deleteRow` commands.

**Requirements:**
- When running, Webpack should return `No type errors found.`
- Every variable should use TypeScript when possible.

### Project 9

#### 9. Namespace & Declaration merging
**Mandatory**

Create a new directory `task_4` and copy the above `tsconfig.json` and put this `package.json` in there:

```json
{
  "name": "task_4",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "",
  "main": "index.js",
  "scripts": {
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"
  },
  "keywords": [],
  "author": "",
  "license": "ISC",
  "devDependencies": {
    "@typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin": "^2.4.0",
    "@typescript-eslint/parser": "^2.4.0",
    "typescript": "^3.6.4"
  }
}
```

In `task_4/js/subjects`:

Create a file `Teacher.ts` and write a `Teacher` interface in a namespace named `Subjects`:
- The interface requires `firstName` and `lastName` as `string`.

Create a file `Subject.ts` and write a `Subject` class in the same namespace named `Subjects`:
- The class has one attribute `teacher` that implements the `Teacher` interface.
- The class has one setter method `setTeacher` that accepts a teacher in argument (and as setter, set the instance attribute `teacher` with it).

Create a file `Cpp.ts` and make the following modifications in the same namespace:
- Using declaration merging, add a new optional attribute `experienceTeachingC` (`number`) to the `Teacher` interface.
- Create a class `Cpp` extending from `Subject`.
- Write a method named `getRequirements` that will return a string `Here is the list of requirements for Cpp`.
- Write a method named `getAvailableTeacher` that will return a string `Available Teacher: <first name of teacher>`. If the teacher doesnâ€™t have any experience in teaching C, then the method should return a string `No available teacher`.

Create a file `React.ts` and write a `React` class in the same namespace:
- Add a new attribute `experienceTeachingReact?` (`number`) to the `Teacher` interface.
- In the class, write a method named `getRequirements` that will return a string `Here is the list of requirements for React`.
- Write a method named `getAvailableTeacher` that will return a string `Available Teacher: <first name of teacher>`. If the teacher doesnâ€™t have any experience in teaching React, then the method should return a string `No available teacher`.

Create a file `Java.ts` and write a `Java` class in the same namespace:
- Add a new attribute `experienceTeachingJava?` (`number`) to the `Teacher` interface.
- In the class, write a method named `getRequirements` that will return a string `Here is the list of requirements for Java`.
- Write a method named `getAvailableTeacher` that will return a string `Available Teacher: <first name of teacher>`. If the teacher doesnâ€™t have any experience in teaching Java, then the method should return a string `No available teacher`.

**Requirements:**
- When running, Webpack should return `No type errors found.`
- Every variable should use TypeScript when possible.

### Project 10

#### 10. Brand convention & Nominal typing
**Mandatory**

Create a directory `task_5` and copy these configuration files into the root of `task_5`: `package.json`, `tsconfig.json`, `webpack.config.js`.

Create two interfaces `MajorCredits` and `MinorCredits` in `task_5/js/main.ts`:
- Each interface defines a number named `credits`.
- Add a `brand` property to each interface in order to uniquely identify each of them.

Create two functions named `sumMajorCredits` and `sumMinorCredits` in `task_5/js/main.ts`:
- Each function takes two arguments `subject1` and `subject2`.
- `sumMajorCredits` returns `MajorCredits` value and `sumMinorCredits` returns `MinorCredits` value.
- Each function sums the credits of the two subjects.

**Requirements:**
- When running, Webpack should return `No type errors found.`
- Every variable should use TypeScript when possible.
